# Exploring Caching Approaches for Performance and Scalability
* Caching is technique used in computer science and web development to store and reuse the data more quickly ,it is temporary storage area ,it is a high 
  speed data storage layer.it is implemented by RAM.
  
### Types of Caching :
### In-Memory Cache : Stores data in the computer's RAM,making access very fast.
### Distributed Caching : Uses multiple servers to store data, ensuring reliability and scalability.
### Client-Side Caching : Saves data on the users device,like a web browser.
### CDN Caching : Stores copies of static files like images and videos in various global locations,speeding up access.

### Advantage of using Caching :
* By using Caching we can access the frequently used data in less time and improves system performance and responsiveness.
* Reducing the access of data from original source ,improves the scalability and reliability.
* It reduces the use of expensive hardware device.
* Faster data access leads to a smoother and quicker user experience.
* Helps applications handle more users by offloading data requests from the main database.
  
### DisAdvantage of using Caching :
* If cache consistency is not maintained properly, then rise issue in data consistency.
* if eviction  policies are not designed properly then there be data loss.
* It makes system more diffcult to design, implement, and maintain.
* Caching requires additional storage space, which might be a concern in resource-limited environments.
* Cached data can be a security risk if not properly protected.
