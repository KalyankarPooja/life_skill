# Exploring Caching Approaches for Performance and Scalability
caching makes application faster and more efficient by storing the frequently used data.
Types of Caching :
### In-Memory Caching : Stores data in the computer's RAM,making access very fast.
### Distributed Caching : Uses multiple servers to store data, ensuring reliability and scalability.
### Client-Side Caching : Saves data on the users device,like a web browser.
### CDN Caching : Stores copies of static files like images and videos in various global locations,speeding up access.

### Advantage of using Caching :
** Improved performance : By using Caching we can access the frequently used data in less time and improves system performance and responsiveness.
** Reduced load on the original source : Reducing the access of data from original source ,improves the scalability and reliability.
** Cost saving : It reduces the use of expensive hardware device.
### DisAdvantage of using Caching :
* Data inconsistency : If cache consistency is not maintained properly, then rise issue in data consistency.
* Cache eviction issues : if eviction  policies are not designed properly then there be data loss.
* Additional Complexity : It makes system more diffcult to design, implement, and maintain.
